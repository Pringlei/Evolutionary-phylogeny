In some research institutes of Mexico, we are interested in the root of cacti and how its evolutionary events helps them to survive in hot environments. One of the ways to know this is studying the molecular pathways that regulates their growth. The WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5) gene is one of many genes that maintain the root and its our interest to find how its regulate inside of cacti that make these kind of plant the most resilient of the whole planet.

To explore the participation of WOX5 in root growth in Cactaceae, we identified WOX-like sequences in the de-novo assembled transcriptomes of the primary root apex of two Cactaceae species: Pachycereus pringlei and Carnegiea gigantea. Additional to this, we extracted WOX protein sequences of some other plants of interest. We build a molecular phylogeny, identified two conserved motifs and draw the exon-intronic structure of WOX genomic sequence that allowed us to identify two possible paralogs, WOX5a and WOX5b, in C. gigantea and Hylocereus (now Selenicereus) undatus genomes. We identify these genomic sequences in preliminary genomes of other Cactaceae species: Lophocereus schottii, Selenicereus undatus, Pachycereus pringlei and Stenocereus thurberi.
